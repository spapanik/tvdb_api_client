``tvdb_api_client`` is an unofficial API for the TVDB.

In a nutshell
-------------

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way is to use `poetry`_ to manage your dependencies and add *tvdb_api_client* to them.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    tvdb_api_client = "*"

Usage
^^^^^

Initialise the client (example using the django cache):

.. code:: python

    from django.core.cache import cache
    from tvdb_api_client import TVDBClient

    client = TVDBClient("username", "user_key", "api_key", cache)

Once the client has been initialised, you can use it to get the following info:

* get TV series by TVDB id
* get TV series by IMDb id
* find identifying info for a TV series by its name
* get episodes by TV series using its TVDB id
